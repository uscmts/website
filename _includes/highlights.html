<p>The National Strategy on the Marine Transportation System (2023-2028) was initiated by an ad hoc interagency development team in January 2022.  The 2023 National Strategy replaces the 2017 National Strategy and provides strategic guidance to the Federal interagency partnership to enhance the Federal understanding and support of the marine transportation system (MTS) under five priority areas.  The Strategy went through interagency reviews, and was approved by the CMTS Coordinating Board before being signed by Transportation Secretary, Pete Buttigieg on March 3, 2023.

<p>HUGE congratulations are in order for our Executive Director Helen Brohl! Helen retired on January 13th after over 20 years in Federal Service. She was the first ever Executive Director for the CMTS and was appointed to that position in 2006 by then Secretary of Transportation Norma Mineta. Helen was our fearless leader for 17 years, trail blazing the CMTS through countless dynamic issues including Federal infrastructure financing and investment, system performance measures, navigation technology integration and coordination, and integration of marine transportation issues into the President's Ocean Policy and National Export Initiatives. She was honored with an outstanding retirement ceremony at US DOT Headquarters that included leadership and colleagues from MARAD, USACE, USCG, NOAA, GLSLSDC, BSEE, OST, CISA, TSA, ITA, Navy, EPA as well as international and industry friends. Thank you Helen for everything you have done for the CMTS, the MTS, DOT and all of federal service. We miss you already!</p>

				  <p>The CMTS has updated the directory of MTS-related Federal Advisory Committees.  Advisory committees are a way of ensuring public and expert involvement and advice in Federal decision-making. 
                                     In response to the growing number of advisory committees, Congress enacted the <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=Federal+Advisory+Committee+Act&filters=sid%3a2e3723a7-4144-befe-ad7f-5ce36a4cda5b&form=ENTLNK" target="_blank">Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA)</a> which established the guidelines under which all Federal advisory committees 
                                     must operate.  There are 36 committees that directly or indirectly impact the MTS.  The list also includes advisory groups that are not official federal advisory committees but are included because

				  <p>The CMTS Maritime Resilience Integrated Action Team (RIAT) fosters interagency engagement to incorporate the concepts of resilience into the operation and management of the U.S. Marine Transportation System (MTS).  The RIAT is co-led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Over the past few years, the RIAT focused on studying the response and resilience of the MTS after major hurricanes.  On November 16, 2022, the RIAT held a hybrid (in person and virtual) meeting where 28 members across 12 agencies were in attendance.  The team discussed the future release of a MTS Resilience Assessment Guide and how it might be used to conduct resilience assessments.  The workshop allowed the RIAT members the opportunity to discuss possible gaps in resilience assessment and response, and ways to close those gaps.  The workshop attendees also compiled a list of organizations they would like to bring to the table for future collaborations.  For more information and publications of the RIAT, go to

                                      The video, presented in both English and Spanish, was developed as a tool to educate students from an early age and well before a career path has been chosen about career options including as a mariner, dock worker, ship building, and culinary arts.  The video was coordinated by the CMTS Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Task Team and the Recruitment and Retention Task Team to support federal MTS-agency efforts to increase the diversity of the marine transportation system but also address a critical shortage of mariners with Federal employers such as military sealift command and the NOAA Corps, as well as to support the critical shortage of U.S. merchant mariners with in industry.

                                      This is the first in a planned series of videos that will provide more detailed information.  The next video will be about a career as an unlicensed mariner and is due to be published in September.  Please direct inquiries to <a href="mailto:careersafloat@dot.gov">careersafloat@dot.gov</a>.

                                     May was Mental Health Awareness Month and the CMTS Mariner Mental Health Working Group (MMHWG) reminds mariners that one year ago, and prompted by the stressors related to working under COVID 19, the U.S. Coast Guard
                                     issued Marine Safety Information Bulletin 07-21 that spotlighted the mental health of mariners.  The prolonged nature of the pandemic compounded existing stressors and created new stressors on maritime personnel, including
                                     feelings of isolation, and physical and mental fatigue caused by pandemic-related restrictions on crew changes, shore leave, and repatriation of seafarers. USCG sought to assure mariners that seeking mental health care will not
                                     jeopardize a mariner's medical certification. In fact, the National Maritime Center (NMC) routinely approves medical certification for individuals who have stable, well controlled mental health conditions.  MSIB 07-21 may be found

                        The CMTS is pleased to announce a collaboration with the DOT National Transportation Library (NTL) to hold all digital documents from the CMTS going forward. With the recent temporary unavailability of the CMTS website, we recognized the need for a more permanent location for CMTS publications. Working within the NTL Repository & Open Science Access Portal or ROSA-P, the CMTS is now included in the collections at <a href="https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/browse/collections" target="_blank">https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/browse/collections</a>, along with other transportation-related information such as the Bureau of Transportation Statistics Maritime and Ports collection and Transportation Climate Change Clearinghouse. The CMTS is also providing non-DOT agency maritime-related products that have been associated with or reference the CMTS. The also means that links to CMTS products on the CMTS website will be the NTL link &#45; a link that will never change!

                                      In December 2021, the CMTS Maritime Resilience Integrated Action Team issued the third report in a series about the response and resilience of the marine transportation system after major hurricanes.  This report, An Examination of Multi-Hazard Marine Transportation System (MTS) Response and Recovery Operations during the 2020 Hurricane Season, assessed the impacts to ports from the 2020 hurricane season and the challenges to federal agencies to respond under pandemic.  Three storms were examined in-depth, due to their impacts on the MTS: Hurricanes Laura, Sally, and Delta.

                        At the CMTS Coordinating Board meeting held July 21, 2021, the Board approved a CMTS proclamation on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).  This document sets a foundation for interagency engagement related to DEI within the CMTS member maritime agencies and in support of DEI within the marine transportation system.  The Coordinating Board further approved the establishment of a &#34;DEI Task Team&#34; led by the CMTS Executive Secretariat which has begun developing a workplan to implement the directive which includes engagement with the Ship Operations Cooperative Program at their annual fall event in September 2021.
