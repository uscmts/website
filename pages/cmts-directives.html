							<h4>Coast Guard and Marine Transportation Act of 2012</h4>
							<p>
								On December 20, 2012, President Obama signed into law the
								<cite>Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2012 (Pub. L. No. 112-213)</cite>. With this action, the CMTS is officially recognized by Congress and is authorized in law, giving our interagency Partnership new authority, new responsibilities, and new opportunities.
							</p>
							<p>
								<cite>Section 310 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act</cite> amends
								<cite>Title 46, United States Code</cite>, by adding
								<cite>Â§55502, United States Committee on the Marine Transportation System</cite>. The stated purpose of the Committee is to serve as a Federal interagency coordinating committee to (1) assess the adequacy of the marine transportation system; (2) promote the integration of the marine transportation system with other modes of transportation and other uses of the marine environment; and (3) coordinate and make recommendations with regard to Federal policies that impact the marine transportation system.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Act also confirms the existing CMTS membership of agencies; allows for these agencies to transfer facilities, equipment, services and personnel, funds, and other support services to carry out CMTS activities; permits the CMTS to consult with MTS-related advisory committees, interested parties, and the public; and directs the Committee, not more than one year after the date of enactment and every five years thereafter, to report on steps taken to implement actions recommended in the
								<cite>National Strategy for the Marine Transportation System: A Framework for Action</cite> and provide an assessment of the condition of the marine transportation system.

							<h4>Ocean Policy Task Force Report</h4>
							<p>
								President Obama, in signing
								<cite>Executive Order 13547: "Stewardship of the Ocean, Our Coasts, and the Great Lakes,"</cite> adopted the recommendations contained in the
								<cite>Final Recommendations of the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force (July 19, 2010)</cite>, and directed executive agencies to implement those recommendations under the guidance of a National Ocean Council (NOC). The report recognizes, among other things, that the Ocean, our Coasts, and the Great Lakes play a critical role in our Nation's transportation, economy, and trade, as well as in the global mobility and readiness of our Armed Forces and the maintenance of international peace and security, and directs the CMTS to coordinate with the NOC governance structure through the White House National Economic Council.

							<h4>CMTS Charter</h4>
							<p>The Charter for the CMTS went into effect on August 11, 2005; it defines the parties, authority, purpose, organization, and agency responsibilities with respect to the CMTS. Among other things, its defines the CMTS as a partnership of Federal agencies with responsibility for the Marine Transportation System (MTS) â€“ waterways, ports and their intermodal connections â€“ and directs them to improve Federal agency coordination to promote the safety, security, efficiency, economic vitality, environmentally sound integration, and reliability of the US Marine Transportation System (MTS) for commercial, recreational, and national defense requirements. Coordination includes budget and regulatory activities that impact the MTS.</p><p>
								On Thursday, April 12, 2018, the Coordinating Board approved a few amendments to the Charter for the United States Committee on the Marine Transportation System (CMTS) to include both voting and non-voting members in Sections (IV) (2) (A) (i); (IV) (2) (B) (i); and (V) (1) &amp; (2) of the document.  Also, the Coordinating Board approved changing 46 U.S.C. Â§55502 to 46 U.S.C. Â§ 55501, throughout the document as well.  This is the result of a CMTS Congressional statutory language change in December 2014.
