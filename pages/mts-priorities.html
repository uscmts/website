				<h1>MTS Priorities and CMTS Recommendations</h1>
				<section>
					<h2>OPTIMIZE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE</h2>
					<p>1. Provide interagency expertise in support of the development of a high fidelity freight flow model.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Measurement: Develop a research statement for a high-fidelity multimodal freight flow model.</li>
						<li>Measurement: Coordinate and apply Big Data analytics to reveal research gaps and overlap, foster potential collaboration, manage knowledge, and inform decision-making.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>2. Increase data access, linkages and integration of authoritative data from agencies and organizations with mission areas related to maritime data and the broader intermodal freight flow network.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Measurement:  Create specific MTS system-scale performance indicators that relate to the freight flow network so they may be periodically updated and used for network calibration and validation.</li>
						<li>Measurement: Couple the newly-available vehicle probe data sets with more traditional freight data resources to quantify and contextualize travel times, dwell times, trip counts and other metrics.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>3. Provide interagency MTS expertise in support of the reduction of system congestion and supply chain bottlenecks.</p>
					<ul><li>Measurement: Engage and support Federal partners, as appropriate, including DOT’s reporting requirements under the FAST Act and existing foundational work performed by CMTS member agencies.</li></ul>

				<h2>ENHANCE NAVIGATION SAFETY</h2>
				<p>4. Develop and maintain a CMTS-member agency list of most-wanted improvements to enhance or sustain safety of the MTS including U.S. Arctic navigation.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Measurement: Once the list is established, monitor reduction in the number of safety-related concerns from the most-wanted list.</li>
					<li>Measurement:  Provide updates on the recommended actions in the CMTS report, "Priorities of Investments to MTS Infrastructure in the U.S. Arctic."</li>
				</ul>
				<p>5. Deliver timely, relevant, accurate and user-accessible navigation safety information to mariners.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Measurement: Reduce the latency of navigation safety information.</li>
					<li>Measurement: Examine NTSB, USCG and other sources of accident investigation information for root and contributing causes related to navigation information.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>6. Incorporate MTS resilience and recovery capabilities into waterway design principles to best identify appropriate levels of service relating to delivery of navigation safety services.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Measurement: Decrease the number of vessel delays related to loss of navigation services that are not due to natural causes such as high or low water.</li>
					<li>Measurement: Coordinate waterway-based resilience risk analyses and models with land-based initiatives across the Federal government.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>7. Support the presentation of best available weather information in support of MTS operations.</p>  
				<ul>
					<li>Measurement:  Form a weather task force to analyze the weather information dissemination and develop best practices for various weather conditions, particularly from extreme weather situations common in the MTS environment.</li>
					<li>Measurement:  Support NOAA’s requirement of Increased number of ship-provided weather observations available for use in extreme weather forecasting.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>SUPPORT MARITIME SECURITY</h2>
				<p>8. Develop CMTS-member agency list of most wanted MTS security improvements.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Measurement: Produce a catalog of Federal maritime security programs that support interagency assessments and engagements in maritime security initiatives.</li>
					<li>Measurement: Determine interagency priorities through CMTS member engagement and coordination with National Security Counsel's maritime security working group.</li>
				</ul> 
				<p>9. Develop policies, as needed, intended to advance security-related information sharing while acknowledging and supporting cyber security requirements.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Measurement:  Provide support to the interagency related to coordination for implementation of The National Strategy for Maritime Security.</li>
					<li>Measurement:  Support interagency initiatives that advocate the sharing of maritime related data related to cyber security.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>ADVANCE ENERGY INNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT</h2>
				<p>10.  Promote interagency collaboration encouraging the development of alternative fuels for propulsion purposes.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Measurement:  Establish an interagency working group to support interagency collaboration in the development of alternative fuels.</li>
					<li>Measurement:  Report the development, types, availability, and use of alternative fuels.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>11. Develop a priority list of MTS-related strategies to support domestic energy innovation and development; identify technologies and innovations that lead to more efficient and cheaper energy use (e.g. alternative fuels, shore power applications, conversion to all-electric cranes, vessel pilot projects).</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Measurement: Adoption rate of strategies on the priority list by MTS users, including Federal agencies and private operators.</li>  
					<li>Measurement:  Encourage the vessel operators to use maritime information to reduce the need for lightering, risk of oils spills, and more efficient fuel use.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>FACILITATE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT</h2>
				<p>12. Develop and use decision support tools to identify nationally significant priority areas and project locations where Agencies can leverage a variety of funding opportunities.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Measurement: Percentage of MTS infrastructure projects vetted against the decision support tool.</li>
					<li>Measurement: Number of instances of aligned projects recommended for funding and implementation.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>13. Facilitate innovative private sector financing mechanisms to augment Federal funds, including the use of Public-Private Partnerships (P3's) and other alternative financing tools.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Measurement: Number of projects using existing alternative financing to leverage Federal MTS investments.</li>
					<li>Measurement: Percent increased use of new alternative financing mechanisms.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>14. Encourage career opportunities in MTS fields; particularly transitioning Military and Veterans’ communities.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Measurement: Increased number of military training courses to meet Merchant Mariner credential requirements.</li>
					<li>Measurement:  Enhanced outreach to encourage merchant mariner credentialing.</li>
				</ul>
