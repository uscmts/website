				<h1>U.S. ARCTIC MARINE TRANSPORTATION INTEGRATED ACTION TEAM</h1>
				<blockquote>
					"The Arctic States hold a responsibility to safeguard the future development of the
					region and to develop models for stewardship of the marine environment. This
					requires both a better understanding of the drivers and effects altering the Arctic
					marine environment and enhanced cooperation amongst the Arctic States, local
					inhabitants, external actors and international legal frameworks."

					<h2>Purpose</h2>
					<p>
						The CMTS, through the work of the integrated action team (IAT), has responded to the call of Congress and the White House to coordinate domestic transportation policies and determine
						what is needed to improve the U.S. Arctic marine transportation system (MTS). Through its recommendations and member agency actions, maritime transportation in the U.S. Arctic will be
						better managed and made more safe and secure, resulting in more efficient transits, greater protection of Arctic coastal and ocean resources, maintenance of subsistence uses by native
						communities, and less risk to loss of cargo and life.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Value</h2>
					<p>
						Warming conditions and reduction in the extent of sea ice cover in the Arctic are creating new opportunities and challenges in the U.S. Arctic region with respect to marine transportation.
						Ensuring a safe and efficient U.S. MTS in the Arctic is essential to meeting the nation's environmental, economic development and national security objectives.

							<h4>March 2022. Published a U.S. Arctic MTS Infrastructure Risk Resource Compendium:</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The U.S. Arctic Marine Transportation System Infrastructure Risk Resource Compendium <a href="https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/62311" target="_blank">https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/62311</a> is a list of literature related to the identification, analysis and mitigation of risks derived from marine transportation system (MTS) infrastructure gaps in the U.S. Arctic compiled to aid and inform federal investment priorities and decisions in the region for the safety and security of the Arctic MTS. This report is in response to a recommendation to the U.S Committee on the Marine Transportation System (CMTS) by the Government Accountability Office in Report #GAO-20-460.

The report details how future natural resource activities, commercial shipping, infrastructure development, oceanographic research, tourism, and ship construction may influence vessel traffic in the region over the next ten years. The Most Plausible Scenario estimates that 377 vessels could be in the region by 2030, representing a nearly 50% growth over current levels and over 200% growth from 2008 levels.
