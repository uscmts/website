				<h1>MARITIME INNOVATIVE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATED ACTION TEAM</h1>
				<section>
					<h2>Purpose</h2>
					<p>The Maritime Innovative Science &amp; Technology IAT (MIST IAT) provides the CMTS with a strategic capability to identify, coordinate, develop, and implement innovative science and technology initiatives and policies to address the pressing challenges identified in the National Strategy on the Marine Transportation System: Channeling the Maritime Advantage (2017).</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Value</h2>
					<p>A coordinated "Innovative science and technology" strategy will enable the nation to address marine transportation infrastructure challenges efficiently and effectively, meet increasing freight demand, promote safety and security of the MTS, and address the environmental impacts of the MTS.</p>

					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>In Spring 2018, this IAT changed its name from the Research and Development (R&amp;D) IAT to the Maritime Innovative Science &amp; Technology (MIST) IAT to encompass broader science and technological advances to the marine transportation system (MTS). Over the course of its time, this IAT has organized six biennial innovative science and technology conferences in alongside the Transportation Research Board (TRB), bringing together academia, industry, and federal agencies to address opportunities and challenges within the MTS and highlight innovative science and technology solutions. The IAT provides strategic capabilities to the CMTS, educating and informing partner agencies through innovative webinars and workshops. Sponsored events have included round tables, presentations, and discussion on autonomous technology, maritime decarbonization efforts and engineering with nature.</p>

							<span>Completed</span>: The IAT co-hosted the June 2016 CMTS-TRB Conference 
							<a href="http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/conferences/2016/CMTS/Program.pdf" target="_blank">From Sail to Satellite: Delivering Solutions for Tomorrow's MTS</a>, which included over 80 technical presentations that covered a wide range of topics critical to the operation of the MTS; 3 panel sessions with noted academic, industry, and government panelists, discussing the future of the MTS; and 3 keynote speakers providing a vision for the MTS. New topics not traditionally seen as "maritime" (for example, big data) were addressed. CMTS Coordinating Board Chair VADM Brown opened the conference, and US Transportation Command Commander General McDew gave the keynote speech. There was also special coordination with the PIANC USA Young Professional group to include tours of the working waterfronts of Washington, DC and Baltimore. PIANC is The World Association for Waterborne Transport Infrastructure.
