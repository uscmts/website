				<h1>Mariner and Workforce Integrated Action Team</h1>
                                <section>
					Advancement of the recruitment, retention, diversification, and well-being of the existing and
					future workforce within the MTS is critical to ensure a well-functioning domestic and
					international freight and logistics supply chain. In March 2022, the CMTS Coordinating Board
					approved the establishment of the <i>Mariner and Workforce Integrated Action Team</i>. (Workforce
					IAT). The Workforce IAT will act as an umbrella forum to provide guidance and leadership to
					the various subcommittees addressing specific issue areas.
					<br><br>
					The Workforce IAT will continue to:<br>
					<ul>
					     <li>demonstrate superior awareness in promoting diversity, equity, justice, and inclusion within the MTS workforce.</li>
					     <li>encourage career advancement and professional development in MTS fields.</li>
					     <li>support Federal outreach, recruitment, and retention process by engaging underrepresented communities on career opportunities of the MTS.</li>
					</ul>
					This IAT's goal is to bring attention to the vital importance of the U.S. merchant marine for
					national security, safety, and prosperity, and aims to more easily facilitate the transition of
					active-duty service members into the U.S. maritime industry. In order to ease the healthy work
					climate, MTS will promote an interagency forum for discussions and initiatives related to the
					health and well-being of the MTS workforce.

                    <p>The CMTS Mariner Mental Health Working Group (MMHWG) is an interagency working group of the CMTS, led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Since the first MMHWG meeting on March 2022, the Working Group has held monthly meetings and has met with employers, unions, non-governmental organizations, and mental health experts in an effort to better understand needs and challenges for mariner mental health.</p>
