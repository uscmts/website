				<h1>MARITIME DATA INTEGRATED ACTION TEAM</h1>
				<section>
					<h2>Purpose</h2>
					<p>The purpose of the Maritime Data IAT is to serve as the CMTS's body of experts in regard to the discovery, access, and sharing capacity of data related to the operation and governance of the MTS. The work of the Maritime Data IAT includes facilitating the identification, archiving, linking, and integration of authoritative data from agencies with equities in maritime data. Access to interoperable and shareable authoritative data will assist CMTS member agencies in making timely and well-informed decisions that enhance the capabilities of the MTS as well as fulfill strategic analysis and reporting requirements.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Value</h2>
					<p>Efforts by the Maritime Data IAT will benefit the Nation by (1) improving maritime data discoverability and access through common standards, (2) enhancing informed decision-making through access to authoritative data, and (3) optimizing CMTS member mission effectiveness through shared services and interoperability.</p>

					<h2>Activity and Milestones</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<span>March 2019</span>: AIS Task Team completed report entitled <a href="../assets/docs/topic_maritime/Accessibility_and_Usability_of_AIS_Data.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Enhancing Accessibility and Usability of Automatic Identification System (AIS) Data: Across the Federal Government and for the Benefit of Public Stakeholders</i></a>. 
						</li>  
						<li>
							<span>August 2018</span>: Hosted open meeting at TRB Annual Meeting on the topic of Automatic Identification System (AIS) accessibility and requirements across public and private stakeholders. 
						</li>  
						<li>
							<span>Fall 2017</span>: Established the AIS Task Team to assess gaps and challenges in the acquisition and use of AIS data, with the goal of eliminating resource overlaps, increasing data accessibility, and sharing developed capabilities and expertise between agencies. 
						</li> 
						<li>
							<span>August 2016</span>: A Maritime Data topic was created at 
							<a href="https://www.data.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data.gov</a> to increase discoverability of maritime data topics.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>August 2016</span>: The 
							<a href="http://navigation.usace.army.mil/MTS/Performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Performance Measures</a> website was launched in coordination with the R&amp;D IAT to help understand how maritime components are functioning within the larger, complex MTS. 
						</li> 
						<li>
							<span>2016</span>: The 
							<a href="../assets/docs/topic_maritime/MTS_Performance_Measures_research_2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marine Transportation System Performance Measures Research</a>, including historical context and a discussion of how the first generation performance measures describe the MTS as an integrated system and fit into a larger freight flow plan, was published in June 2016 by the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC). 
						</li> 
						<li>
							<span>August 2015</span>: The Data IAT coordinated interagency review and participation in the development of the maritime-related sections of the Department of Energy's
