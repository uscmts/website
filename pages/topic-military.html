						<h2>Purpose</h2>
						<p>The purpose of the CMTS Military to Mariner (M2M) Initiative is to help coordinate Federal efforts to facilitate the transition from military service to civilian employment in the U.S. Merchant Marine and/or other positions within the Marine Transportation System.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Value</h2>
						<p>Military sea-service veterans have specialized training and experience needed by the United States Merchant Marine. Facilitating the transfer from military service to merchant mariner increases the number of qualified mariners needed to support our economy and national defense.</p>
