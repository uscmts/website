						<h2>Purpose</h2>
						<p>The MTS Resilience IAT (R-IAT) was established to focus on cross-Federal agency knowledge co-production and governance in order to incorporate the concepts of resilience into the operation and management of the U.S. Marine Transportation System. For the purposes of this team, resilience is defined as the ability to prepare and plan for, resist, recover from, and more successfully adapt to the impacts of adverse events.</p>
					</section>-->
					<section>
						<h2>Value</h2>
						<p>The R-IAT seeks to affect future resilience policy and aid in delivering enhanced resilience programs through identifying, coordinating, and leveraging complementary Federal investments and activities related to MTS resilience.</p>

             							<span>June 2022</span>: As a result of the collaboration between RIAT agencies, the CISA, USACE ERDC, and the Coastal Resilience Centers of Excellence Universities of Vanderbilt and Rhode Island have partnered to collaboratively develop a Marine
								Transportation System Resilience Assessment Guide. The Guide presents a process and resources for organizing and understanding the complicated systems that comprise the MTS. It also includes three case studies investigating 1) seismic resilience at the Port of Portland, 2) resilience of supply chains at the
								Tennessee/Cumberland Rivers, and 3) the interconnectivity of a network of ports in the Caribbean. The Guide and case studies were presented at a PIANC webinar on June 15th, 2022. A recording can be found <a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DOTK7zgUqKvE&data=05%7C01%7Cdaniel.ogden.ctr%40dot.gov%7C245e80c4c2414809a40108da637f73c8%7Cc4cd245b44f04395a1aa3848d258f78b%7C0%7C0%7C637931696387675428%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=JKTZa7yn%2FVnlPnudYoqwAncaOeUlul0A44GcmjC%2BX2s%3D&reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

             							<span>In December 2021</span>: The CMTS Maritime Resilience Integrated Action Team issued the third report in a series about the response and resilience of the marine transportation system after major hurricanes.  This report, An Examination of Multi-Hazard Marine Transportation System (MTS) Response and Recovery Operations during the 2020 Hurricane Season,â€ assessed the impacts to ports from the 2020 hurricane season and the challenges to federal agencies to respond under pandemic.  Three storms were examined in-depth, due to their impacts on the MTS: Hurricanes Laura, Sally, and Delta.
